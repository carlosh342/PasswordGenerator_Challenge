# PasswordGenerator_Challenge
 The code presented on this page is the code required for my module 3 Challenge. The point of the challenge was to complement already existing code by creating a password to be displayed on the screen for a user. To complete this challenge I used a series of for, do-while, and while loops to ask the user questions about the characteristics of their password. These included the length of the password, and whether they wanted the password to be composed of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, or numeric values. To complete this task I utilized the already mentioned loops to ask the user repeatedly about their choices until they made their decision. I would like to note that while I used a prompt command for character length, I used the confirm command for the other questions since is more user-friendly. With this information gathered, I concatenated an empty string with all the characters the user decided to use. This string, in turn, supplemented a password algorithm that used a psudorandom algorithm to choose random characters in the aforementioned string. This process was repeated with a while loop until the desired password length was achieved.
